# OPSYS-Project1

Project made for Operation Systems (OPSYS) at RPI in the Spring of 2022

This project is made to model a CPU, and how algorithms and other variables
can affect the efficiency of how a CPU can run.

This particular project focuses on four algorithms, First Come, First Serve
(FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time (SRT), and Round
Robin (RR). It also takes into account differing values such as lambda and
alpha which are used in random number generation for the dummy processes,
and the calculations that estimate CPU Burst times for preemption-based
algorithms such as SRT and RR.
